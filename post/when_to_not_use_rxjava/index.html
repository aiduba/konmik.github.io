  <h1 class="headline" itemprop="headline">When to NOT use RxJava</h1>
  <section class="body" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>RxJava is very powerful.
It solves a great amount of tasks easily.
But using it in wrong places can turn any codebase into an unmaintainable and buggy mess.
Here I will try to explain where RxJava can help and in which cases it is better to avoid using it.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="basic-example">Basic example</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a very simple and obvious example of a wrong RxJava
usage and go into theoretical details later.</p>

<p>It is often can be found that people inspired with RxJava
start turning everything into a stream.
We even got a new mantra - &ldquo;Everything is a stream&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Say, you need to implement <code>int max(int, int)</code> function (let&rsquo;s pretend it does not exist yet).
What will you think if you will discover an implementation like this
that was proudly created for you by a newbie who can&rsquo;t wait to apply the new magical hammer?</p>

<h4 id="figure-a">Figure A.</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span></span><span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">max</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">left</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">right</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">zip</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">left</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">right</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">?</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Interesting, yeah?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When you have a hammer everything looks like a nail.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A sane developer will probably say &ldquo;WFT??!&rdquo; and implement something
less shiny and inspiring but more practical:</p>

<h4 id="figure-b">Figure B.</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">max</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">?</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>There is even an option to refactor the old code like this:</p>

<h4 id="figure-c">Figure C.</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span></span><span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">max</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">left</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">right</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">zip</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">left</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">right</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">MyMath</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">max</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But in practice such a weird <code>max</code> implementation is just a consequence of other
weird functions that for some reason will look better if <code>max</code> works with observables.</p>

<p>This example can be easily scaled into any
size &ndash; people turn into stream <em>everything</em> literally.</p>

<p>You can easily discover code like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span></span><span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">getId</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">just</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In a large codebase it happens all the time.</p>

<p>Or you can find a 20-line function of operators
that is doing the job that can easily be done without RxJava
with the same amount of code!
Try debugging a flow of events while the person who wrote it
did not even think about events.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not telling that mantras do not work.
I hope that at this point it is pretty obvious by itself. ;)</p>

<h2 id="so-what-is-exactly-wrong-here">So what is exactly wrong here?</h2>

<p>The entire rant is about simplicity.</p>

<p><strong>Figure B.</strong> says:
&ldquo;take two ints and return one of them that if bigger&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Figure A.</strong> says:
&ldquo;Take two streams of integers, they will emit values once in a while, and there
will probably be not equal amount of values in these streams, and these streams
will probably will never emit any values, but just take these two streams
and create another one that will wait unless both streams will emit at least one value,
and return a value every time this happens, and the value should be
the maximum of these two values, but if one of streams will return less values then
you should wait unless it will emit something and you should buffer
items of another stream while you&rsquo;re waiting.
Keep in mind that I
can subscribe any number of times and you need to create the new sequence every time.
There is also a possibility to unsubscribe at any moment, so you will also need
to unsubscribe from these two streams.
Both streams can emit new values on different threads
so you will need to emit the next value on the thread of the latest emission.
Propagate all exceptions and stop stream once it happens.
Stop returned stream if one of incoming streams stops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The enthusiastic developer will probably say:
&ldquo;But we will never have such conditions!
Both streams will always have exact amount of values,
and I&rsquo;m not going to use multithreading here,
and&hellip; and&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>C&rsquo;mon, tell this to your mother.</p>

<p>Bugs happen all the time and one day one of these observables
will NOT return any value and your app will just hang.
And it will happen with 10% of all of your users.
And you will not even get a stacktrace because nothing crashes.
Or you will get a stacktrace, but it will not change anything,
because RxJava stacktraces is something special.</p>

<h2 id="do-not">DO NOT</h2>

<h4 id="the-absence-of-event">The absence of event</h4>

<p><strong>Do not</strong> use RxJava if there is no &ldquo;event&rdquo;. Just don&rsquo;t.
If something does not say: &ldquo;this will happen at some point in time&rdquo;,
do not create observables.</p>

<p>RxJava is not a <em>data processing</em> library.
It is an <em>event processing</em> library.</p>

<p>Events are more complex than data
because in addition to data events have <em>time</em> or <em>order of execution</em>.</p>

<p>If you need to process a list of items, do not turn it into an observable.</p>

<p>In addition to the complexity that will increase
for the person who will try to understand
the code there are additional downsides.
Have you seen RxJava source code?
It contains quite complex logic, so it is hard to debug.
It also consumes additional resources to make multithreading safe.</p>

<p>If you want to use functional programming while you do not have Java 8 streams,
just take a third-party library or write a couple of utility functions.
Your code will be much simpler and there will be less possibilities for bugs.</p>

<h4 id="the-absence-of-subscription">The absence of subscription</h4>

<p>If you do not need to keep track of subscriptions, <strong>do not</strong> use RxJava.</p>

<p>Subscription means that there is an entity
that emits values and it <em>knows</em> that you&rsquo;re listening.
And it will likely dispose itself if listeners are gone.</p>

<p>Without having subscriptions it is simpler to have usual callbacks.</p>

<h2 id="do">DO</h2>

<p>If it seems to you at this point that using RxJava is an entirely bad idea,
there <em>are</em> very good use cases where RxJava really shines.</p>

<h4 id="multithreading">Multithreading</h4>

<p>Not much libraries compare to RxJava when it comes
to dealing with multithreading code.
Having a simple way to schedule function calls on different threads
is priceless.</p>

<h4 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions</h4>

<p>Having a simple way to unsubscribe from an event source
is the feature that is hard to overestimate.
Forget about writing callback interfaces, lists of subscribers,
event dispatching loops, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="good-practices">Good practices</h2>

<h4 id="side-effects">Side effects</h4>

<p><em>Side effect</em> &ndash; is when function modifies variables outside of its scope
or makes I/O. Side effects should normally be executed in a specific order,
for example <code>print</code> that prints information to console creates a side-effect
and if you will call several <code>print</code> in wrong order you will get wrong output.
If you modify variables in wrong order you will also likely have bugs.</p>

<p>RxJava has very clear semantic for using it with functions which
create side-effects. This is useful when you&rsquo;re trying to
understand someone&rsquo;s code, and it can also save you from having
more bugs.</p>

<p>Use <code>do*</code> operators for creating side effects:
<code>doOnNext</code>, <code>doOnError</code>, etc.
You can also use <code>subscribe</code> function callbacks.</p>

<p>It is wrong to use other functions (<code>Observable.map</code> for example)
for creating side-effects
because it assumes that you&rsquo;re just transforming one value into another.
A developer who will try to modify your code
will think that it is OK to place this transformation into
a different place, put it into another thread
or even completely remove it while refactoring.
If your <code>map</code> was saving the values into the database
or was showing them on the screen
then the refactoring will cause bugs.</p>

<h4 id="simple-first">Simple first</h4>

<p>Once you need to execute some action in background, it is
better to implement it as a simple function first,
and only then wrap it into an observable in case you need it.</p>

<p>In some cases you will discover that composition of
non-rx code is <em>easier</em> than having an observable that
does hell knows what else.</p>

<p>Simple code can be turned into complex very easy.
It is hard to do the opposite.</p>

<h4 id="single-thread-first">Single thread first</h4>

<p>This is a sub-rule for &ldquo;Simple first&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Once your function returns an observable,
it is better to not schedule the returned observable
on a specific scheduler inside the function.</p>

<p>Unpredictable things can happen if the caller does not expect
to get multithreading from the returned observable.</p>

<p>Let the caller decide where it wants to schedule it.</p>
